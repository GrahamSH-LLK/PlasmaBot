# PlasmaBot - An Open Source Bot for Discord

PlasmaBot is an Open Source Moderation and MusicBot for Discord!  It is currently in development and new features are being added constantly!  The bot is plugin-based, and will eventually have the ability to pull plugins from an approved plugin repo and enable/disable on a per-server basis, enabling a vast expansion and customizability of the bot.  Plugins are being developed frequently, adding new and improved functionality to the bot.  Currently, the bot has 5 plugins: Moderation, Custom Commands, TBA (FRC Team Lookup), Utilities, and Meme Generation.
