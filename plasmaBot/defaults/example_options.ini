; Opening this file in Notepad (WINDOWS) will corrupt this file.  Don't do it.

; THIS IS THE CONFIGURATION FILE FOR PlasmaBot
; Editing the configuration items within this file will change global settings for the bot.


[Credentials]
; These are the login settings for PlasmaBot.  Editing these will allow the bot to connect with your accounts

; Bot Account Setup
; Bot Accounts use a token to connect and have less restrictions than normal accounts
; Public Bots must use a bot account.

Token = Token_From_Developer_Applications_Panel

; User Accounts
; PlasmaBot can also use a user Account.
; To use a User Account, remove the "; " before the Email and Password Fields and
; add a "; " before the Token above.  Failure to do this will cause errors in config parsing.

; Email = discord_bot@gmail.com
; Password = discord_bot_password

; Self Bot
; Initialize this bot as a SelfBot (meant when running off of your account instead of a bot account)
; To use a Self Bot, Use a User Account instead of the Token as above.
; This config item, when enabled, will prevent the bot from responding to anyone but the Owner as defined below, and the bot's account.
; AKA, others won't be able to use the bot, but you will.
; yes = yes, no = no

SelfBot = no


[OwnerInfo]
; PlasmaBot needs to know some information about you in order to successfully run and give you permissions
; Fill in your User ID (or that of the bot owner account) below to gain elevated permissions
; This ID can be found through typing >id in the PlasmaBot Test Server ( https://discord.gg/011Vbr8fyWLeMLg1B ) or
; through enabling Developer Mode in the Discord Client, right clicking the bot-owner account, and clicking Copy ID.

OwnerID = 000000000000000000


[BotConfiguration]
; Configuration on the Appearance of the bot in Bot Responses and it's responsiveness

; This is the name by which the bot will be called in Bot Responses.  The Default Name is 'PlasmaBot' although it can be changed here.

BotName = PlasmaBot

; The Game that will show up next to the Bot in the Server List
; Certain Variables can be passed in to the Game.  {prefix} passes in the server prefix and {server_count} passes in the # of servers connected

BotGame = {prefix}help | {server_count} servers

; This is the prefix by which standard commands will be preceded by when called in Discord.
; Changing this will change commands from being recognized as >command to {prefix}command
; For example, setting the prefix at ! will make >id become !id
; Be careful to remember what you set this value to, as it can effect your ability to debug problems with commands if forgotten.

CommandPrefix = >

; Delete Messages sent by the bot after some time.
; Bot must have permission to delete it's own messages.

DeleteMessages = yes

; Delete the Invoking Messages sent to fire bot commands.
; This will only work if and when DeleteMessages is enabled AND the bot has "Manage Messages" Permissions in a channel.

DeleteInvoking = no

; Allow Invitations to non-personal servers
; With a bot account, this will provide an OAuthURL to the User who fires the command.
; With a User Account, the bot will attempt to join a server via a provided Invite Link.
; This will be automatically overridden if called by the Owner Account as marked via OwnerID.

AllowInvites = yes
